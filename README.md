VaDER is a learning project, to help learn Python and better understand the function and limitations of CAT control of the physical radio over USB/Serial. 

Long-term goals include an interface that doesn't look like crap, and useful controls to allow for new users to rapidly get comfortable and make use of their equipment. 

I am not a coding professional, so there will be heavy use of AI assistants and probably more than one dumb question asked to friends and Elmers with more programming and radio experience.
