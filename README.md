VaDER (Voice and Data Enhanced Radio) is a learning project, to help me learn Python and better understand the function (and limitations) of CAT control of a physical radio over USB/Serial. 
Currently, this project is focused on the radio I own - a Yaesu FT-991A - but I hope to be able to include CAT libraries for other models of radio once the basic functionality is established. 

Long-term goals include an interface that doesn't look like crap, and useful controls to allow for new users to rapidly get comfortable and make use of their equipment. 

I am not a coding professional, so there will be heavy use of AI assistants and probably more than one dumb question asked to friends and Elmers with more programming and radio experience.
